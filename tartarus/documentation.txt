Version 0.6.4

Tartarus.sh reads it options from a configuration file specified at the command
line. This file is in fact a shell script and has the duty of setting several
variables that control the behaviour of the backup script. Each configuration
file is called a profile.

== Configuration options

NAME
    The identifier of the profile; it will be used in the backup filename.

DIRECTORY
    The directory to be backed up; only a single directory name is allowed
    here.

STAY_IN_FILESYSTEM
    When set to "yes", the backup process will not traverse into directories
    residing on different partitions. This is useful when backing up /, since
    you do not want to traverse into /proc or /sys.
    
    Valid options:
        * yes
        * no

EXCLUDE
    A list of directories you wish to exclude from the backup. While Tartarus
    will not descend into the directories, they themselves will be included
    in the backup (without their contents). Since the configuration file is
    read like a shell script, globbing and expansion may occur.

EXCLUDE_FILES
    A list of directories from which no files will be saved, while its 
    subdirectories will be stored in the backup. This is useful if you want
    to preserve the directory structure while discarding the file content.

CREATE_LVM_SNAPSHOT
    If this is set to yes, Tartarus will try to freeze the content of the LVM
    volume specified with LVM_VOLUME_NAME - The snapshot will then be mounted
    and used as the backup source.

    Once set, the specification of LVM_VOLUME_NAME, becomes mandatory.
    
    Valid options:
        * yes
        * no

LVM_VOLUME_NAME
    The LVM logical volume to take a snapshot from before backing up: Be sure
    to specify the correcet volume your DIRECTORY is on, otherwise weird things
    might happen (mandatory if CREATE_LVM_SNAPSHOT is enabled).

LVM_MOUNT_DIR
    The directory your volume is usually mounted; please specify an absolute
    path here (mandatory if CREATE_LVM_SNAPSHOT is enabled).

LVM_SNAPSHOT_SIZE
    The amount of disk space to allocate for snapshot differences. Make sure
    your volume group has enough free space for this (Default value is 200 MB).

ASSEMBLY_METHOD
    The method you would like to employ to combine your file system into an coherent
    data archive. The default method is "tar", but tartarus also supports the more
    modern "afio" format. You must have the corresponding archive program installed.

    Valid options:
        * tar
        * afio

STORAGE_METHOD
    Specifies the way the backup data should be stored.

    Valid options:
        * FILE 
            Store the backup archive as a file on the local system.
        * FTP
            Save the backups archive to an FTP server.
        * SIMULATE
            Don't actually save the file, but send it to /dev/null
        * CUSTOM
            Allows you to specify a custom storage method by defining a shell
            function named "TARTARUS_CUSTOM_STORAGE_METHOD". See below for an
            example that uses SSH to transmit the backup to a remote location.

STORAGE_FILE_DIR
    If STORAGE_METHOD is set to "FILE", this variable specifies the directory
    Tartarus places the backup archive in.

STORAGE_FTP_SERVER
    The FTP server you wish to store your backup on.

STORAGE_FTP_USER
    The username to log into the FTP server.

STORAGE_FTP_PASSWORD
    The password for logging into the FTP server.

STORAGE_FTP_DIR
    The directory of the ftp server the backup is stored in.

STORAGE_FTP_USE_SSL
    Specifies whether to use SSL when connecting to the FTP host.

    Valid options:
        * yes
        * no

STORAGE_FTP_SSL_INSECURE
    Ignore problems regarding the server certificate.

    Valid options:
        * yes
        * no

STORAGE_CHUNK_SIZE
    The maximum file size (in MiB) the storage medium can handle. If this is set,
    the backup archive will be split in several files. It can be used to circumvent
    limitations in old FTP servers or file systems that cannot handle files larger
    than 2 GiB.

COMPRESSION_METHOD
    The compression method you want to apply to your backup stream.

    Valid options:
        * none
        * gzip
        * bzip2

ENCRYPT_SYMMETRICALLY
    If enabled, the backup data will be encrypted using a password read from
    the file specified by ENCRYPT_PASSPHRASE_FILE.

    Valid options:
        * yes
        * no

ENCRYPT_PASSPHRASE_FILE
    The file the password for backup encryption is read from. The password is
    needed to restore the backup, so you better write it down.

ENCRYPT_ASYMMETRICALLY
    If enabled, the backup data will be encrypted using the public key
    specified by ENCRYPT_KEY_ID. If both ENCRYPT_SYMMETRICALLY and
    ENCRYPT_ASYMMETRICALLY are enabled, decryption will be possible with the
    private key or the supplied passphrase (one of them is sufficient).

    Valid options:
        * yes
        * no

ENCRYPT_KEY_ID
    The key id you wish to encrypt your backup for. Check "gpg --list-keys" for
    valid key ids.

ENCRYPT_KEYRING
    The keyring file you wish to read. If unspecified, gnupg uses the user keyring.

INCREMENTAL_TIMESTAMP_FILE
    A timestamp file that is updated on each succesfull full backup run and
    used as a reference point for future incremental backups

INCREMENTAL_BACKUP
    Don't create a full backup but only save files that have been modified
    after the file set by INCREMENTAL_TIMESTAMP_FILE has been touched. Instead
    of enabling this option in the configuration file, you can also call
    tartarus.sh with the option "-i".

    Valid options:
        * yes
        * no

LIMIT_DISK_IO
    When set to "yes", Tartarus uses "ionice" to change the scheduler data for
    the backup run. The backup process will only get disk time when no other
    program is requesting it.

    Valid options:
        * yes
        * no

CHECK_FOR_UPDATE
    Tartarus checks whether a new version of the script is available. It will
    then print as message about it and continue with the backup. To disable
    this behaviour, set this variable to "no".

    Valid options:
        * yes
        * no

== Basic configuration examples

Suppose you want to backup your home directories on a regular basis; the
compressed archive will be stored on a FTP server. This can be achieved easily
with just a few lines of tartarus configuration. Let's call the profile
definition »/etc/tartarus/homedirs.conf«:

# That's the profile name
NAME="homedirs"
DIRECTORY="/home"
# We store it using FTP, on the fly
STORAGE_METHOD="FTP"
STORAGE_FTP_SERVER="ftpbackup.hostingcompany.com"
STORAGE_FTP_USER="johndoe"
STORAGE_FTP_PASSWORD="verysecret"
COMPRESSION_METHOD="bzip2"

By calling »tartarus.sh /etc/tartarus/homedirs.conf« the script will gather all
files below /home, compress them using bzip2 and store it on the FTP server
ftpbackup.hostingcompany.com.

== LVM snapshots

Backing up a partition that is in use can lead to inconsistent backups. To
avoid this, Tartarus supports the use of LVM snapshots to "freeze" the block
device and operate on that static copy. The real volume can still be used while
changes done to the file system structure are not reflected on the "frozen"
block device.

To use this feature, the file system you wish to back up has to reside on an
LVM volume and the volume group has to have some free space to store the
differences between snapshot and real volume that accumulate during the backup
run. You also have to make sure that the directory /snap does exist, since
tartarus mounts the created snapshot volume below that directory.

A few additional lines instruct Tartarus to use the snapshot functionality:

# Users keep on working
CREATE_LVM_SNAPSHOT="yes"
LVM_VOLUME_NAME="/dev/volumegroup0/home"
LVM_MOUNT_DIR="/home"
# Allocate enough space for any changes during the backup run
LVM_SNAPSHOT_SIZE="1000m"

== Incremental backups

Storing a full backup takes a lot of disk space; Often just storing the files
that changed since the last backup is more desirable - this is called a
incremental backup.

Tartarus can create a flag file on your system that is used as a reference
point when doing the next incremental backup. To do this, just add the
following line to your config:

INCREMENTAL_TIMESTAMP_FILE="/var/spool/tartarus/homedirs"

Everytime a full backup run succeeds, this file is "touched" by Tartarus.

To create an incremental backup based on that file, just add these lines
to a profile:

INCREMENTAL_BACKUP="yes"
INCREMENTAL_TIMESTAMP_FILE="/var/spool/tartarus/homedirs"

Instead of copying the profile file and adding the lines, you can also just
reuse the existing configuration profile and start Tartarus with the option
"-i": 'tartarus.sh -i /etc/tartarus/homedirs.conf' will create an incremental
backups based on the latest flag file deposited by the last full run.

== Encryption

Tartarus supports symmetric encryption through gpg (GNU Privacy Guard). To
utilize it, write your passphrase into a file, for example
»/etc/tartarus/backups.sec«, and place it at a safe location: You might need it
one day to restore your precious backup data. Now tell Tartarus where to find
the secret passphrase by adding the following lines to your profile:

ENCRYPT_SYMMETRICALLY="yes"
ENCRYPT_PASSPHRASE_FILE="/etc/tartarus/backups.sec"

Also make sure that the passphrase file is only readable by root; otherwise
anyone with access to that file can decrypt your backups.

Asymmetric encryption is also possible. Just specify a key id to encrypt the
backup archive using that public key:

ENCRYPT_ASYMMETRICALLY="yes"
ENCRYPT_KEY_ID="ABC12345"

The resulting backup profile can only be decrypted using the matching private
key.

Symmetric and asymmetric encryption can also be combined: Then one credential, either
the private key or the passphrase, is sufficient to decrypt the backup archive.

== Restoring a backup

Even more important than creating a backup is restoring it. Since Tartarus is
largely based on standard unix tools, you won't have to install special
software - even a basic rescue system will suffice to retrieve your lost data.

Given that the backups is stored on an FTP server, compressed an encrypted, we
need the following tools to restore it:

- curl, wget or any other FTP client
- gpg to decrypt the backup stream
- gzip or bzip, depending on the compression method used
- tar to extract the archive
- afio (or cpio) to extract the archive when using this file format

This enumeration is also the order in which to apply these programs; First
download the tar archive to your system, then use "gpg --decrypt" to, well,
decrypt it. After that you can expand the file by using "gzip -d" (or the
equivalent of bzip2) and retrieve the "naked" tar archive, which can then be
manipulated by the usual tar commands.

If you do not have enough disk space to store the entire backup, you can also
restore it on the fly; just use the "pipe" feature of any unix shell:

# curl ftp://USER:PASS@YOURSERVER/home-20080411-1349.tar.bz2.gpg \
  | gpg --decrypt \
  | bzip2 -d \
  | tar tpv

The tar command "tpv" prints the archives content while using numeric UID/GID
values for files (so it won't change file ownership while in the rescue system).
If you really want to extract the archive, replace "t" with an "x" (eXtract).

If you are using the afio file format, compression does not take part on the
entire stream, but is handled by afio itself on a per file basis. The command
line for listing such a backup might look like this:

# curl ftp://USER:PASS@YOURSERVER/home-20080411-1349.tar.bz2.gpg \
  | gpg --decrypt \
  | afio -Z -P bzip2 -t -

To restore incremental backups, just restore the last full backup as well as the
most recent incremental one.

== Defining a custom storage method

Tartarus supports the creation of custom storage methods. No changes to the program
are necessary to achieve this: Simply set the storage method in the configuration file
to "CUSTOM":

STORAGE_METHOD="CUSTOM"

Then define a shell function with the name "TARTARUS_CUSTOM_STORAGE_METHOD". The method
should read the backup data from STDIN, while the proposed archive filename is stored in
the shell variable "$FILENAME". The following example uses the secure shell to transmit
the archive to a remote location:

TARTARUS_CUSTOM_STORAGE_METHOD() {
  local USER="stefan"
  local HOST="zirkel.wertarbyte.de"
  debug "Sending backup to $USER@$HOST:~/$FILENAME through SSH..."
  ssh $USER@$HOST "cat > ~/$FILENAME"
}

Any exit code except 0 is considered an error and will abort the backup
process. If the archive is to be split into multiple chunks, the storage method
might be called more than once.

== Tartarus processing hooks

For special configuration purposes, the Tartarus scripts offers special hooks
where user supplied code can be placed and executed during the backup
procedure.

The following hooks are called during the run of the program:

TARTARUS_PRE_PROCESS_HOOK
    Called right after the config file has been read and the program starts

TARTARUS_POST_PROCESS_HOOK
    Called right before the program terminates gracefully, before the cleanup
    procedure

TARTARUS_PRE_CONFIGVERIFY_HOOK
    Called before the configuration gets verified (after TARTARUS_PRE_PROCESS_HOOK)

TARTARUS_POST_CONFIGVERIFY_HOOK
    Called after all configuration options and command line arguments have been inspected

TARTARUS_PRE_CLEANUP_HOOK
    Called before the cleanup procedure runs, the variable ABORT indicates whether
    the program terminated gracefully

TARTARUS_POST_CLEANUP_HOOK
    Called at the end of the cleanup procedure

TARTARUS_PRE_FREEZE_HOOK
    Called right before a LVM snapshot is created

TARTARUS_POST_FREEZE_HOOK
    Called right after a LVM snapshot has been created

TARTARUS_PRE_STORE_HOOK
    Called right before the backup data is gathered and stored

TARTARUS_POST_STORE_HOOK
    Called right after the backup has been stored

TARTARUS_DEBUG_HOOK
    Called whenever a debug message (contained in the variable DEBUGMSG) is printed

Each segment of the backup procedure - gathering , bundling, compression,
encryption and storage - itself is also embraced by a pair of hooks. Those
functions however are integrated into the pipeline that transports your backup
data, so writing to STDOUT or reading from STDIN in a hook might destroy your
data. Only do so if you know exactly what you are doing.

TARTARUS_PRE_FIND_HOOK / TARTARUS_POST_FIND_HOOK
    Executed before/after the find process gathers the files to be saved

TARTARUS_PRE_TAR_HOOK / TARTARUS_POST_FIND_HOOK
    Executed before/after tar bundles the files to an archive stream

TARTARUS_PRE_COMPRESSION_HOOK / TARTARUS_POST_COMPRESSION_HOOK
    Executed before/after the data stream is handled by the compression software

TARTARUS_PRE_COMPRESSION_HOOK / TARTARUS_POST_COMPRESSION_HOOK
    Executed before/after the data stream is processed by the encryption software

TARTARUS_PRE_STORAGE_HOOK / TARTARUS_POST_STORAGE_HOOK
    Executed before/after the stream is handed over to the storage function

To use a hook, define a shell function of the name in your config file.

As an example, this hook function transfers all debug messages to your syslog
system:

TARTARUS_DEBUG_HOOK() {
    echo $DEBUGMSG | logger 
}

Hooks can also increase the reliability of the snapshot functionality. LVM
snapshots can lead to slightly inconsistent file systems, since they do not
freeze the file system, but the underlying block device. This is why Tartarus
calls 'sync' right before creating the snapshot volume. Most filesystems can
cope with that issue. But if you want to make sure that the snapshot file
system is valid, hooks can be used to run a file system check on the snapshot
volume before mounting it:

TARTARUS_PRE_FREEZE_HOOK() {
    # make sure everything is synced to disk
    # before snapshotting
    sync
}

TARTARUS_POST_FREEZE_HOOK() {
    # we can access the internal variables
    # of the tartarus process, but take care!
    #
    # $SNAPDEV should contain the volume we are
    # about to mount, try auto-repair
    /sbin/fsck -y "$SNAPDEV"
}

== Removing obsolete backups from an FTP server

Tartarus is accompanied by the perl script "charon.pl", which roams an FTP
server and removes any backups archives that match a certain pattern and exceed
a specified age. Configuration is done via command line arguments, check the
output of "charon.pl --help" for a detailed list.

# charon.pl --host safehaven --user john --password SECRET --dir / --maxage --profile home --dry-run

This command line will try to log into the server "safehaven" using the user
name "john" and his password "SECRET" and remove backup file from the profile
"home" with are more than 7 days old. Due to the command line switch
"--dry-run", no files are actually deleted - the script will only explain its
potential actions in its output.

Charon will never remove a full backup until a incremental one depends on it;
it will be deleted once all depending backups are expired.

The script does not read tartarus backup profiles; by using hooks however it
can be called from Tartarus after completing a successfull backup run. This
way, Tartarus can pass the configuration variables to Charon:

# Hook in Charon
TARTARUS_POST_PROCESS_HOOK() {
    # pass configuration variables to charon
    # transmit the password through stdin to hide it from "ps ax"
    local CHARON="/usr/local/sbin/charon.pl"
    local MAX_AGE_IN_DAYS="7"
    echo -n "$STORAGE_FTP_PASSWORD" | $CHARON \
        --host "$STORAGE_FTP_SERVER" --user "$STORAGE_FTP_USER" \
        --readpassword \
        --dir "$STORAGE_FTP_DIR" \
        --maxage "$MAX_AGE_IN_DAYS" \
        --profile "$NAME"
}

TARTARUS_POST_PROCESS_HOOK will only be executed in case of a successfull
backup, so there won't be any files removed if tartarus encounters an error.
